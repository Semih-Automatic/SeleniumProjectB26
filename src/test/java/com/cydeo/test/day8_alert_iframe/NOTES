- DROPDOWNS:

Q: How many types of dropdowns we have?
A: 2

#1- HTML Dropdowns (non-select)
    - If the dropdowns are created using anything other than <select> tag, it is a "non-select dropdown"

#2- Select Dropdowns
    - If dropdown is created using <select> tag, it is a select dropdown
    - To be able to use the Select class from Selenium, it has to be <select> dropdown.

 ----------------------------------------------

Q: How do you handle dropdowns?

1. First I will inspect and see what type of dropdown it is.
2. If it is HTML dropdown (non-select), I will just locate with any locator and click.
3. If it is <select> dropdown, I will use Select class coming from Selenium library.

------------------------------------------------

Q: Syntax of how do we handle Select dropdown?

1. We create object of Select class
2. We need to locate the dropdown <select> tag itself and pass it into the Select constructor.

    Select dropdownName = new Select(driver.findElement(By.LOCATOR));

3. We can use the object for handling the dropdowns.

    dropdownName.selectByVisibleText("content(text) btw opening and closing <option> tag");
    dropdownName.selectByValue("value of value attribute");
    dropdownName.selectByIndex(int); // starts form 0


Q: How do we select options from a Select dropdown?
A: We can use 3 methods provided by Selenium library
    - selectByIndex
    - selectByValue
    - selectByVisibleText

----------------------------------------------------

Q: How do we get currently selected option?
A: .getFirstSelectedOption();
   - this method can be used to get the default value
   - also can be used to get the value after selecting something.
   - return type is single WebElement


Q: How do we get all of the options from a Select dropdown?
A: .getOptions method
   - return type is List<WebElement>

- ALERT:

Q: What is an alert?
A: - Some pop-ups happening on the page.
   - Developers use alerts to get users attention to deliver some content.


Q: How many types of alerts do we have?
A: We have 2 types of Alerts.

1. HTML Alert (Non-JS Alert)
    - This will be present inside of the <html> page as some web element.
    - There is nothing special about this alert, we just locate and click

2. Javascript Alert
    - We have 3 types of Javascript alerts

    #1- Information/Warning Alert:
        - User can ONLY accept this alert.

    #2- Confirmation Alert:
        - User can accept and decline.

    #3- Prompt Alert:
        - User can accept, decline, and also sendKeys.


Q: How do we handle Alerts using Selenium?
A: - I will check the type of the alert.
   - After making sure it is a JS alert, I will use Alert from Selenium library to switch drivers focus to the Alert itself.

    Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();

    alert.accept();
    alert.dismiss();
    alert.sendKeys("string");
