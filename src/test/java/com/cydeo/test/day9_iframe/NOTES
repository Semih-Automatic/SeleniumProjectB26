Q: What is an iframe?
A:  - An iframe is HTML within another HTML page.
   - Most of the time it is used to create independent sections in a page for advertisements, maps, video content or anything independent.

Q: How do we handle iframes?
A: - Selenium WebDriver can focus on one thing at a time.
   - Therefore we must switch its focus from the default <html> to iframe <html> before being able to do any action inside of it.

Q: What happens if we do not switch to inner frame?
A: If we try to locate any web element before switching, we will get NoSuchElementException

Q: How many ways we have to switch to inner iframe?
A: 3

 #1- by index:
        - starts from 0
        - we count

    syntax: driver.switchTo().frame(index);

 #2- by id-name value
        - if there is id or name attribute we can just pass their values as a string

    syntax: driver.switchTo().frame("id-name value");

 #3- by locating it as a web element
        - we locate the iframe tag itself as a web element and pass it into the method.

    syntax: driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement);
    syntax: driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElement(By.locator));

- How do we go switch driver's focus to default iframe?
    driver.switchTo().parentFrame();
    driver.switchTo().defaultContent();
